I have Scriptable Objects in my Folder StudentData with all the information of each students (Name,FirstName,Surname,Profile Picture and Job)

I have a script CreditsMenu that you have to put in your Canvas for displaying the information of students. In this script, you have a list of student, a list of Text who group (Name,FirstName,Surname) and List of Image => Profile picture.

Change the size of the list Text and list Image if you want to change the number of students that you want to display in the canvas and change the number of child Text in Hierarchy. You have a context menu in the script for move to next Page (right click on the CreditsMenu in Inspector)
